## General Family Law Firm Outreach

### Who to Target

**Ideal Law Firms:**

- **Family law specialists** (not general practice)
- **Small to mid-sized firms** (2-15 attorneys) - more agile than large firms
- **Tech-forward firms** that have modern websites and use case management software
- **Firms with multilingual services** (German + English at minimum)
- **Location:** Berlin, Hamburg, NRW (where your tool has regional data)

**Where to Find Them:**

- Rechtsanwaltskammer directories
- Google: "Familienrecht Anwalt [city]"
- Legal tech directories
- LinkedIn searches

**Red Flags (Skip These):**

- Firms that exclusively handle high-net-worth cases (€500+/hr rates)
- Very traditional firms with outdated websites
- Sole practitioners who are 60+ years old (less likely to adopt new tech)
- Firms that focus only on corporate/commercial law

---

### Initial Contact Strategy

**Best Approach: Email + LinkedIn Connection**

**Timing:**

- Tuesday-Thursday, 10 AM - 2 PM (when lawyers check email between meetings)
- Avoid Mondays (swamped from weekend) and Fridays (winding down)

**Subject Line Examples:**

- "Tool für Ihre Mandanten: Selbstauskunft vor dem Erstgespräch"
- "Reduce intake time + improve client prep - Custody Clarity demo"
- "Free tool for your family law clients - partnership opportunity"

**Email Structure:**

1. **Hook** (1 sentence) - Problem you solve
2. **Credentials** (2 sentences) - Why you built this + your credibility
3. **Value Proposition** (3 bullet points) - What's in it for them
4. **Soft Ask** (1 sentence) - Low-commitment next step
5. **Signature**

**Example Email (English):**

```
Subject: Free tool for your family law clients - partnership opportunity

Dear [Attorney Name],

Many parents come to initial consultations unprepared, without understanding their custody options under German law - wasting valuable billable time on basic education.

I'm Olaniyi Aborisade, a software engineer and father navigating the German custody system myself. I built Custody Clarity (custodyclarity.com), a free tool that educates parents about their rights and generates preliminary documentation before they ever contact a lawyer.

For your practice, this means:
• Clients arrive at consultations already educated on joint custody, contact orders, and BGB basics
• Reduced intake time - they've already answered structured questions about their situation
• Higher conversion - informed clients are more likely to retain counsel
• Zero cost - we're seeking feedback from family law professionals

Would you be open to a 15-minute call next week to see a quick demo? I'd value your perspective as a legal professional.

Best regards,
Olaniyi Aborisade

Betreff: Kostenloses Tool für Ihre Mandanten - Kooperationsmöglichkeit

Sehr geehrte/r [Anwaltsname],

Viele Eltern kommen zu Erstgesprächen unvorbereitet an, ohne ihre Sorgerechtsoptionen nach deutschem Recht zu verstehen - das kostet wertvolle abrechenbare Zeit für Grundlagenvermittlung.

Ich bin Olaniyi Aborisade, Software-Entwickler und Vater, der selbst durch das deutsche Sorgerechtsystem navigiert. Ich habe Custody Clarity (custodyclarity.com) entwickelt, ein kostenloses Tool, das Eltern über ihre Rechte aufklärt und vorläufige Dokumentation generiert, bevor sie überhaupt einen Anwalt kontaktieren.

Für Ihre Kanzlei bedeutet das:
• Mandanten kommen bereits über gemeinsames Sorgerecht, Umgangsregelungen und BGB-Grundlagen informiert an
• Reduzierte Aufnahmezeit - sie haben bereits strukturierte Fragen zu ihrer Situation beantwortet
• Höhere Mandatierung - informierte Mandanten beauftragen eher einen Anwalt
• Keine Kosten - wir suchen Feedback von Familienrechtsexperten

Wären Sie offen für ein 15-minütiges Gespräch nächste Woche für eine kurze Demo? Ich würde Ihre Perspektive als Rechtsprofi sehr schätzen.

Mit freundlichen Grüßen,
Olaniyi Aborisade

## Dr. Burmeister Specific Strategy

### Context Assessment

**What You Know:**

- He's handling your criminal case (racial discrimination/profiling)
- You've already paid him (financial relationship established)
- He doesn't know about your custody battle yet
- He's a criminal lawyer, not family law

**Strategic Considerations:**
✅ **Pros:**

- Existing trust and relationship
- He already sees you as a client fighting injustice
- Criminal lawyers often know family law colleagues (can refer you)
- He may empathize with your custody situation given your discrimination case

⚠️ **Cons:**

- He's not a family law specialist (won't use your tool directly)
- May feel you're piling on too many issues at once
- Might worry about your ability to pay if you're spreading resources thin

---

### Recommended Approach with Dr. Burmeister

**Separate Conversations, Strategic Timing**

**Step 1: Mention Your Custody Battle (Next Meeting for Criminal Case)**

Don't lead with the tool. First, establish the human context.

**In-Person or Call (When discussing your criminal case):**

> "Dr. Burmeister, I wanted to update you on something personal that's affecting me during this time. Beyond the discrimination case we're working on, I'm also in a difficult custody battle for my children. It's been... mind-deteriorating, honestly.
>
> My ex is using my financial situation against me, which makes winning the criminal case even more important. I just wanted you to know, as it's weighing heavily on me right now."

**Why This Works:**

- Human connection - he sees the full picture of what you're fighting
- Contextualizes your stress/urgency
- Doesn't ask for anything, just shares
- Natural segue for him to offer help or ask questions

**His Likely Response:**

- "That's terrible, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have a family law attorney?"
- "How is that affecting you?"
- "Is there anything I can do to help?"

**Your Response:**

- If he asks if you have representation: "Not yet - I've been navigating it myself while working on a tool to help other parents in similar situations. Actually, I built something that might interest some of your family law colleagues..."
- If he offers help: "Actually, I'd love your advice on something related. I built a legal tech tool for custody cases. Do you know any family law attorneys who might be interested in this kind of thing?"

---

**Step 2: The Tool Pitch (Follow-Up Email After That Conversation)**

**Wait 2-3 days after mentioning your custody battle. Then send this email:**

```
Betreff: Custody Tool - Feedback von Kollegen?

Hallo Dr. Burmeister,

vielen Dank nochmal für das Gespräch neulich. Es bedeutet mir viel, dass Sie meine Situation verstehen.

Bezüglich der Sorgerechtssituation, die ich erwähnt habe - während ich das selbst durchgemacht habe, habe ich ein kostenloses Tool entwickelt, um andere Eltern aufzuklären: custodyclarity.com

Es führt Eltern durch ihre Optionen nach deutschem Recht (gemeinsames Sorgerecht, Umgangsregelungen etc.) und generiert vorläufige Dokumente. Derzeit nutzen es etwa [X] Personen pro Woche.

**Meine Frage:** Kennen Sie Kollegen im Familienrecht, die an so etwas interessiert sein könnten? Ich suche Feedback von Anwälten - ob das Tool nützlich wäre, um Mandanten besser vorzubereiten.

Keine Eile - nur wenn jemand in Ihrem Netzwerk in den Sinn kommt.

Herzlichen Dank und bis bald,
Olaniyi

PS: Hier ist ein schneller 2-Minuten-Demo-Link, falls Sie neugierig sind: [custodyclarity.com/interview]
```

**Why This Works:**

- **Builds on established rapport** from previous conversation
- **Asks for a referral, not a sale** - lawyers love making connections
- **Low pressure** - "no rush"
- **Shows hustle** - he'll respect that you're turning pain into a product
- **PS gives him easy way to check it out** without committing

---

**Step 3: If He Makes an Introduction**

When Dr. Burmeister connects you with a family law colleague:

```
Betreff: Einführung von Dr. Burmeister - Custody Clarity

Hallo [Familienrechtsanwalt],

Dr. Burmeister meinte, Sie könnten an Custody Clarity interessiert sein - einem Tool, das ich entwickelt habe, um Eltern vor dem ersten Anwaltsgespräch über Sorgerecht aufzuklären.

Kurz: Es ist eine kostenlose Guided-Interview-Plattform, die:
• Eltern über gemeinsames Sorgerecht, Umgangsregelungen und BGB 1626/1684 informiert
• Strukturierte Fragen stellt (ähnlich wie Anwaltsaufnahme)
• Vorläufige Dokumente mit Rechtszitaten generiert

Für Anwälte bedeutet das, dass Mandanten vorbereitet und informiert ankommen - was Erstgespräche effizienter macht.

Ich würde gerne 15 Minuten nächste Woche für eine Demo finden, falls Sie offen dafür sind. Auch Feedback als Familienrechtsexperte wäre sehr wertvoll.

Vielen Dank für Ihre Zeit,
Olaniyi Aborisade

Demo: custodyclarity.com/interview

### Alternative: If Dr. Burmeister Isn't Responsive

If he doesn't respond or seems uninterested in making intros:

**No problem.** He's a criminal lawyer, this isn't his domain. **Don't push it.**

Instead, pivot to:

1. **Ask if his firm has family law colleagues** (some multi-practice firms do)
2. **Ask for general networking advice:** "As a lawyer, how would you recommend approaching law firms about legal tech tools?"

---

## Value Propositions for Lawyers

When speaking with ANY lawyer, emphasize these benefits:

### 1. **Reduce Intake Time** ⏱️

> "Your clients arrive already educated on custody basics - you can skip the 'What is joint custody?' conversation and focus on strategy."

**Data Point:**

- Average intake call: 30-45 minutes
- With Custody Clarity pre-work: 15-20 minutes
- **Savings:** ~€100-150 in attorney time per client (at €300/hr billing rate)

### 2. **Higher Quality Leads** 📈

> "Informed clients are more likely to retain counsel. They understand the process, know it's complex, and value legal guidance."

**Analogy for Lawyers:**

- Like a doctor whose patient already took their blood pressure at home vs. one who didn't
- The prepared patient is more engaged and compliant

### 3. **Consistent Documentation** 📄

> "All clients answer the same structured questions, so you get uniform intake data - easier to spot issues and build cases."

### 4. **Multilingual Client Access** 🌍

> "Tool supports EN, DE, AR, PL, FR, TR, RU - helps firms that want to serve immigrant communities but lack in-house translation."

### 5. **Zero Risk** ✅

> "It's free for clients, free for lawyers. We're just seeking feedback from professionals. If it's not useful, you've lost nothing but 15 minutes."

---

## Common Objections & Responses

### Objection 1: "This Could Replace Lawyers"

**Response:**

> "Actually, it does the opposite. We explicitly tell users: 'This tool provides education, not legal advice. You should consult a licensed attorney.' In fact, we're considering adding a 'Find a Lawyer' directory where we refer prepared clients directly to partner firms like yours."

**Data to Share:**

- LegalZoom, Rocket Lawyer, etc. have INCREASED demand for lawyers, not decreased it
- Informed clients know they need help; uninformed clients think they can DIY

---

### Objection 2: "I Don't Have Time for This"

**Response:**

> "I completely understand - that's exactly why I built this. It saves YOU time. Clients do the groundwork before they ever contact you. The 15-minute demo is just to show you what your future intake process could look like."

**Offer:**

> "How about this - just give me your email, I'll send you a demo link, and you can explore it in 5 minutes when you have a coffee break. No meeting needed."

---

### Objection 3: "How Do You Make Money?"

**Response:**

> "Great question - we have a few models we're testing:
>
> 1. **Freemium:** Basic tool is free, premium PDF packages (€2.99-€29.99) with court-ready formatting
> 2. **B2B Partnerships:** Law firms can white-label this for their website as a client intake tool
> 3. **Lawyer Directory:** Verified family law attorneys can list in our 'Find a Lawyer' section for a monthly fee
>
> Right now, we're focused on feedback and usage. Monetization comes later."

**Reassurance:**

> "We're not looking for money from you - we want to understand if this is valuable. If it is, we'll build a partnership model that works for both sides."

---

### Objection 4: "I Already Have an Intake Process"

**Response:**

> "That's great - most good firms do. This isn't meant to replace your process, it's a pre-intake step. Think of it as client homework before they even contact you. They arrive already:
>
> - Understanding their options
> - Having thought through key questions
> - Knowing they need legal help (not thinking they can DIY)
>
> Your intake process becomes smoother because they're prepared."

---

### Objection 5: "Is This Legally Compliant?"

**Response:**

> "Yes - we're very careful about this:
>
> - We never provide legal advice, only legal education (citing public BGB provisions)
> - All disclaimers clearly state: 'This is not a substitute for a lawyer'
> - We don't collect sensitive data (no storage of names, addresses, etc. unless user opts in)
> - GDPR compliant - all data stored locally in user's browser, not on our servers
>
> We'd love your feedback as a legal professional on anything we should strengthen."

## Email Templates

### Template 1: Cold Email to Family Law Firm (Formal)

```
Subject: Tool to Prepare Your Clients Before Consultations

Dear [Attorney Name],

I'm reaching out because I believe I've built something that could save your practice significant intake time while improving client preparedness.

I'm Olaniyi Aborisade, a software engineer who recently navigated the German custody system as a father. The experience was overwhelming - I spent weeks just understanding basic concepts like joint custody (gemeinsame Sorge) vs. contact orders (Umgangsregelung). This led me to build Custody Clarity (custodyclarity.com), a free tool that educates parents about their rights before they contact a lawyer.

For family law practices, this means:
• Clients arrive at consultations already familiar with BGB 1626, 1684, and their custody options
• Structured pre-intake questionnaire (saves 15-20 minutes per client)
• Higher-quality leads (informed clients are more likely to retain counsel)
• Multilingual support (DE, EN, AR, PL, FR, TR, RU) for diverse client bases

I'm currently seeking feedback from experienced family law attorneys. Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call next week to see a demo and share your professional perspective?

I'd greatly value your insights.

Hi [Attorney Name],

Thank you so much for taking the time to review Custody Clarity and share your insights. Your feedback about [specific thing they mentioned] was especially valuable.

Based on our conversation, here are potential next steps (no pressure - just options):

Would any of these interest you? Or if not, no worries - I appreciate the time you've already given.

Either way, I'll keep you posted on progress. Thanks again for your support.

Best regards,
Olaniyi

P.S. - If you know other family law colleagues who might find this useful, I'd be grateful for an introduction!

## Key Takeaways

### DO:

✅ Emphasize time savings and lead quality for lawyers
✅ Offer demos, not sales pitches
✅ Ask for feedback, not commitments
✅ Be respectful of their time (lawyers are busy)
✅ Follow up, but don't spam
✅ Build relationships, not transactions

### DON'T:

❌ Claim your tool replaces lawyers (huge red flag)
❌ Oversell - stay humble and data-driven
❌ Ask for money upfront (you're seeking feedback, not sales)
❌ Bad-mouth other legal tech tools (unprofessional)
❌ Send generic mass emails (personalize every message)
