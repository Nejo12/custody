        quote:
          "I spent 10 years in a relationship. When we separated, I discovered I had no legal custody rights. I couldn't see my daughters for months while going through court.",
        author: "Father, Berlin",
      },
      story2: {
        quote:
          "We thought 'we trust each other, we don't need paperwork.' Then the relationship ended, and suddenly trust wasn't enough. The legal battle took 9 months.",
        author: "Parent, Munich",
      },
      takeaway:
        "Establishing custody rights takes one hour at the Jugendamt while your relationship is stable. Fighting for them in court takes months, costs thousands, and causes immense stress.",
    },
    faq: {
      title: "Common Questions",
      q1: {
        question: "We're not married. Does the father automatically have custody?",
        answer:
          "No. In Germany, unmarried fathers have ZERO automatic custody rights. The mother has sole custody by default. Fathers must complete paternity acknowledgment (Vaterschaftsanerkennung) and joint custody declaration (Sorgeerklärung) to have legal rights.",
      },
      q2: {
        question: "When should we establish paternity and custody?",
        answer:
          "As soon as possible—ideally during pregnancy. This can be done at any Jugendamt for FREE. Don't wait until after birth or until relationship problems arise.",
      },
      q3: {
        question: "What if my partner refuses joint custody?",
        answer:
          "You can apply through Familiengericht (family court). Courts usually grant joint custody unless there are serious concerns about child welfare. But this takes 3-9 months and can be expensive. It's always better to establish custody cooperatively.",
      },
      q4: {
        question: "We trust each other. Do we really need legal paperwork?",
        answer:
          "Yes. Trust is not a legal right. If your partner changes their mind, blocks contact, or the relationship ends, you have no recourse without legal custody. Paperwork takes 1 hour and is free. Legal battles take months and cost thousands.",
      },
      q5: {
        question: "Does joint custody mean 50/50 time with the child?",
        answer:
          "No. Joint custody (Sorgerecht) means equal legal authority to make decisions about the child's welfare (medical care, school, residence). Physical time with the child (Umgangsrecht) is separate and can be negotiated or decided by a court.",
      },
      q6: {
        question: "How much does this cost?",
        answer:
          "Paternity acknowledgment and joint custody declaration are FREE at Jugendamt. Birth certificate costs €10-15. If you have to go to court later, expect €2,000-6,000+ in legal fees.",
