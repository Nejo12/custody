          "question": "Is this legal advice?",

        {
          "question": "What is joint custody in Germany?",
          "answer": "Joint custody (gemeinsame Sorge) means both parents share decision-making rights for their child. In Germany, married parents automatically have joint custody. Unmarried parents can apply for joint custody under §1626a BGB if paternity is acknowledged."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I get contact rights if the other parent blocks contact?",
          "answer": "Yes. Under §1684 BGB, you have the right to contact with your child. If contact is being blocked, you can apply to the family court (Familiengericht) for a contact order (Umgangsregelung). Our tool helps you understand your rights and prepare the necessary documents."
        },
        {
          "question": "How long does a custody application take?",
          "answer": "Processing times vary by court and case complexity. Simple joint custody applications can take 2-4 weeks, while contact orders may take 1-3 months. The court will schedule a hearing if needed."
        },
        {
          "question": "Do I need a lawyer?",
          "answer": "For simple joint custody applications, you may not need a lawyer. However, for contested cases or contact orders, legal representation is recommended. You can also get free initial consultations from legal aid organizations."
        },
        {
          "question": "What documents do I need to file?",
          "answer": "Typically: birth certificate, paternity acknowledgment (if applicable), marriage certificate (if married), and any existing court orders. Our tool generates a checklist and cover letter tailored to your situation."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the Jugendamt and do I need to involve them?",
          "answer": "The Jugendamt (Youth Welfare Office) provides free counseling and mediation services. You don't have to involve them, but they can help mediate disputes and provide support. Courts often suggest involving the Jugendamt before or during proceedings."

        },
        {
          "question": "Are the generated documents legally valid?",
          "answer": "The documents are based on standard legal forms and include proper citations. However, you should review them carefully and may want a lawyer to check them before filing. They serve as a starting point, not a final legal document."
        },
        {
          "question": "Can I edit the generated documents?",
          "answer": "Yes. The PDFs can be edited with PDF editing software. However, we recommend using the tool's forms to regenerate documents if you need to make changes, as this ensures all information stays consistent."
        },
        {
          "question": "What is the Vault feature?",
