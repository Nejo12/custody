# Lawyer B2B Pitch Email - Ready to Send

## 🎯 Purpose

These emails are designed to pitch Custody Clarity to family law attorneys as a **client intake tool** that saves them time and improves lead quality.

---

## 📧 Email Template #1: Direct Value Proposition (English)

**Subject:** Save 30 minutes on every family law consultation

**Body:**

```
Hi [Attorney Name],

I'm Olaniyi, a software engineer who recently went through the German custody system myself. The experience was overwhelming - which led me to build something for other parents.

But I realized: **your clients probably arrive to consultations just as confused as I was.**

I built a free tool that pre-educates parents on custody basics before they ever contact you:

**Custody Clarity (custodyclarity.com)**

What it does:
• Explains joint custody, contact rights, and BGB 1626/1684 in plain language
• Asks structured intake questions (marital status, child details, living arrangements)
• Generates a preliminary custody summary with legal citations

**For your practice, this means:**
✅ Clients arrive already informed (you skip the "What is joint custody?" conversation)
✅ Consistent intake data (everyone answers the same structured questions)
✅ Higher retention (informed clients understand they need legal help)

Currently ~200 parents are using it. I'm seeking feedback from family law attorneys to see if this could be useful for your practice.

**Would you be open to a 15-minute demo call next week?**

No cost, no commitment - just want to understand if this solves a real problem for attorneys.

Available times:
• Tuesday 2-4 PM
• Thursday 10 AM-12 PM
• Friday 2-5 PM

Let me know what works!

Best regards,
Olaniyi Aborisade
Software Engineer & Parent

## 📧 Email Template #2: Problem-First Approach (English)

**Subject:** Do your custody clients ask "What is joint custody?" in every consultation?

**Body:**

```
Hi [Attorney Name],

Quick question:

**How much time do you spend explaining custody basics in initial consultations?**

I'm guessing 15-30 minutes per client, covering:
- What joint custody actually means
- BGB §1626 vs §1684
- When sole custody is appropriate
- How to file custody applications

I built a free tool that does this education **before** clients contact you.

**Custody Clarity** - custodyclarity.com

It's a guided interview that:
1. Explains custody types in plain German/English
2. Asks intake questions (marital status, children, living situation)
3. Generates a preliminary custody document with legal citations

**Your benefit:** Clients arrive prepared → shorter consultations → more time for actual legal strategy.

I'm a software engineer (not competing with lawyers!) who went through custody battles myself. Built this for parents like me who were totally lost.

Now I'm wondering: **Would family law attorneys find this useful?**

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to see if this fits your practice?

I'll show you the tool, you tell me if it's helpful. That's it.

Let me know!

Best,
Olaniyi Aborisade

## 📧 Email Template #3: German Version (Formal)

**Subject:** Tool für Ihre Mandanten: Selbstauskunft vor dem Erstgespräch

**Body:**

```
Sehr geehrte/r Herr/Frau [Name],

ich bin Olaniyi Aborisade, Softwareentwickler und selbst Vater, der kürzlich das deutsche Sorgerechts­system durchlaufen musste.

Während dieser Erfahrung ist mir aufgefallen: **Die meisten Eltern kommen völlig unvorbereitet zum Anwalt.**

Ich habe daher ein kostenloses Tool entwickelt, das Eltern vor dem Erstgespräch über Sorgerecht aufklärt:

**Custody Clarity** (custodyclarity.com)

**Was das Tool leistet:**
• Erklärt gemeinsames Sorgerecht, Umgangsrecht und BGB §1626/1684 verständlich
• Stellt strukturierte Fragen (Familienstand, Kinderanzahl, Wohnsituation)
• Generiert vorläufige Dokumente mit Rechtszitaten

**Für Ihre Kanzlei bedeutet das:**
✅ Mandanten kommen informiert zum Erstgespräch
✅ Sie sparen Zeit bei der Aufklärung über Grundlagen
✅ Einheitliche Datenerhebung durch strukturierte Fragen
✅ Höhere Mandatsquote (informierte Klienten erkennen den Wert rechtlicher Beratung)

Aktuell nutzen ~200 Personen das Tool. Ich suche Feedback von Familienrechts­anwälten, ob dies für Ihre Praxis nützlich wäre.

**Hätten Sie Interesse an einer kurzen 15-minütigen Demo nächste Woche?**

Kostenlos, unverbindlich - ich möchte einfach nur verstehen, ob das Tool einen Mehrwert bietet.

Verfügbare Zeiten:
• Dienstag 14-16 Uhr
• Donnerstag 10-12 Uhr
• Freitag 14-17 Uhr

Ich freue mich auf Ihre Rückmeldung!

Mit freundlichen Grüßen,
Olaniyi Aborisade
Softwareentwickler

Hi [Attorney Name],

Just following up on my previous email about Custody Clarity.

I know you're busy, so I'll keep this brief:

**One question:** Do you find that custody clients often arrive to consultations unprepared or confused about basic concepts like joint custody?

If yes, I have a free tool that might help. If not, no worries - I appreciate your time!
